It stores personal details name, email, hometown, graduation date, major, academic records courses, credits, GPA history, and personal info emergency contact, address, social media. It also tracks skills, hobbies, career interests, entertainment backlog, and finances. The program calculates totals like credit hours, GPA average, study hours, budget breakdowns, and even cost per study hour.
